# Race/ethnic disparities in antibiotic use

The file `race.Rmd` is an R Markdown document that reproduces the results from
the manuscript.

The `data/` folders includes `meps.tsv`, the data that `race.Rmd` uses to
compute the results and well as other files that can be used to download the
raw data from the MEPS website and format it for easy use.
