# Race/ethnic disparities in antibiotic use

These files reproduce the results from:

> SW Olesen, YH Grad. Racial/ethnic disparities in antimicrobial drug use, United States, 2014-2015. *Emerging Infectious Diseases* 24(11): 2126-2128 (2018). doi: [10.3201/eid2411.180762](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2411.180762)

The file `race.Rmd` is an R Markdown document that reproduces the results from
the manuscript.

The `data/` folders includes `meps.tsv`, the data that `race.Rmd` uses to
compute the results and well as other files that can be used to download the
raw data from the MEPS website and format it for easy use.
